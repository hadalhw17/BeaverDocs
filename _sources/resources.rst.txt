Resources are a core piece of the engine that is responsible to store state/modules/interfaces, which could be used to build application logic.
The whole engine is build in using resources. The resource can be created using :cpp:func:`Bvr::App::CreateResource`.
This will create and add a resource of specified type to the app; that way the app holds full ownership of the resource.
It is also possible to register existing resource using :cpp:func:`Bvr::App::InsertResource`, which will just register the resource in the app, but not take ownership over it.
All resources can be accessed from the app using :cpp:func:`Bvr::App::GetResource` or by specifying it as input to a :doc:`system<systems>`.

As mentioned previously, resources can be anything, with only restriction being that each resource type can only be registered once,
however if needed, then it is possible to have multiple applications to register multiple resources of the same type.
