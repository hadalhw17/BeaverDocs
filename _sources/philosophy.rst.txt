Engine philosophy

The engine has 3 main execution scopes:
   1. `Reflection scope`_.
   2. `Build scope`_.
   3. `Scheduled scope`_.

Reflection scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Happening inside of *RAVEN_REFLECTION_BLOCK* macro
- Runs once before *main*

Build scope
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Where :cpp:class:`Raven::App` initialisation is happening
- Runs once inside *main*

Scheduled scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Happens after `Build Scope`_ is done
- Runs either:
   - Once if :cpp:func:`Raven::App::RunOnce` is called
   - Untill app is terminated if :cpp:func:`Raven::App::Run` is called

Initialisation
==============

Code engine intialisation is happening inside of the `Build Scope`_, where all plugins are added to the main application.
A plugin must satisfy :cpp:class:`Raven::Plugin` concept.
